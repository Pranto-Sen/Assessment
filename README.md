## What I Learned

1. **Implementing CRUD Operations:**
   - Understanding of the MVC pattern in ASP.NET Core, including creating models, views, and controllers.
   - Using Entity Framework Core for database operations, including setting up the database context, performing migrations, and using LINQ for querying the database.

2. **Data Visualization:**
   - Integrating Chart.js for data visualization on the front-end was a valuable experience. It involved learning how to create different types of charts (line and bar) and customize them.

## Challenges Faced

1. **Handling JSON Data:**
   - Initially, handling the JSON data from the online source was challenging due to the HTML response instead of JSON. This required downloading the file and correctly deserializing it.

2. **Configuring Multi-Axis Chart:**
   - Configuring a multi-axis chart in Chart.js was complex, especially ensuring that the data was displayed correctly and the axes were properly synchronized.

3. **Deployment Issues:**
   - Facing problems in deploying the application, such as setting up the connection string and other configurations for the cloud hosting service.
